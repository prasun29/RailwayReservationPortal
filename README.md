--------MORE INFORMATION---------

The confirmed seats are limited to 50 and RAC to 20 and number of Coaches to 1 in order to show the implementation of waitList easier. It can be increased to as many we want with just few changes in the code to making all 50 to maxseats and 20 to maxRacs and assigning values to both constants. And the number of coaches assigned can be calculated by using divide and modulus function to the seat number allotted appropriately.

The implementation of waitlist is shown in Screenshot(1-8).png where cancellation of tickets moves the waitlist to confirm,RAC and waitlist above.
